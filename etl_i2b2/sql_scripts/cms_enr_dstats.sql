/** cms_enr_dstats - Descriptive statistics for CMS Enrollment.

We build a PCORNet CDM style ENROLLMENT table and compute descriptive statistics.

To distinguish enrollments for part AB, A, B, or D, use ENR_BASIS or RAW_BASIS as follows:

select coverage, count(*) from (
select case when enr_basis = 'I' then raw_basis else enr_basis end as coverage
from enrollment
)
group by coverage;


Note: unlike cms_enc_dstats etc. where the input is only an i2b2 star schema,
in this case we reach back to the CMS RIF tables, because we didn't include
bene_mdcr_entlmt_buyin_ind_01 when we curated columns from RIF to include in i2b2.

To look at just years and months, this is handy:
alter session set NLS_DATE_FORMAT = 'YYYY-MM';

To change it back:
alter session set NLS_DATE_FORMAT = 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI' ;

The monthly state buy-in code specifies whether the state contributed to the premiums for parts A/B.  
It can tell you if the beneficiary had A/B/AB. But it is doesn't tell you HMO status.

That monthly variable you need is: HMO_IND_XX

So you need MDCR_ENTLMT_BUYIN_IND_XX in (1,2,3,A,B,C)  and  HMO_IND_XX in (0)

Note: technically,  you can include HMO_IND_XX in (0, 4) but I've always excluded 
the 'Fee-for-service participant in case or disease management demonstration project' (which is the '4').

These variables can be helpful too
BENE_HI_CVRAGE_TOT_MONS  (number of months of A coverage for that reference year)
BENE_SMI_CVRAGE_TOT_MONS  (number of months of B coverage for that reference year)
